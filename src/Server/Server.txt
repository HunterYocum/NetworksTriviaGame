We will need to set up a server socket to connect to all the clients (easy)

We also need a UDP socket to recieve the UDP responses, havent done this before but I doubt its all that bad

Somethings I think will be tricky will be making sure people can join any time (basically, if someones joins before
the game is started, we can handle this appropriately). 

I am not sure what the requirements for this server are, but it would be cool (and not all that hard) to have a UI 
for this as well. Maybe someone can act as the gameshow host or something. This definitely isnt necessary, but would
be pretty simple and set us apart from the other groups, but perhaps it doesnt fit into the requirements. Maybe the UI
window would show who "pulled" into the queue, who is current trying to answer the question, and aswell show the score
that all the people have. So someone wouldnt necessarily need to control it, but it would show the responses in the UI window
as opposed to use just using the command line.
