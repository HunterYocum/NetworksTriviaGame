In this file, we will have to set up a tcp connection to a server socket in the server file (easy).

We will also need to set up something to send the response back using UDP (answering and "pushing" into the queue)

Also, when ran, this file should open a new java swing window. Maybe we can pass the IP as a command line arugment. I did
this for my last project and was pretty simple.
